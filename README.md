# Configuration

These are config files that allow me to carry over the customizations I am used to with zsh, vim, etc.

Please note that the install script is written for Ubuntu.

## Installing default apps in Ubuntu

The install.sh will remove and install the following:

Remove:
  - Nano

Install:
  - Tmux
  - Ccat
  - Exa
  - Oxide Theme
  - Wget

## To use the script, you must run:

$ chmod +x install.sh
